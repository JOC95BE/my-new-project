# Project Title

Building AI course project

## Summary

SME's in fashion retail pick their collections/stock for the upcoming seasons based on experience from the past years. Providing a prediction of how well (read: fast, without discount) a certain piece would sell based on a picture, would help them making more data-driven decisions.


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

* Picking a collection based on gut-feeling works upon a certain extent, but getting insights into patterns would help.
* My personal motivation comes from a family-owned fashion boutique and being familiar with the current workings of such a boutique. The combination of this, with working in AI for the past couple of years, triggers this idea.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

* The solution would be used by fashion retailers when confronted with the buying decision of certain products. When selecting which pieces to buy from their suppliers, they would be able to give a picture + some metadata (e.g. price, size,..) of the piece and get a score in return. The score would represent the chance that this piece will sell fast.
* The solution should work in real-time as these decisions have to be made on-the-spot
* The solution should be able to handle phone-quality pictures


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?

Historic data from fashion webshops have information on sales, timing and related images. This historic data can be used to build a first model. However, I assume using data from a specific retailer to fine-tune the model will lead to better predictions for that specific shop. 

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

Small shops have a limited amount of data and while the current pandemic has forced them to move their business more online, a lot of transactions are still physical which makes it harder to link pictures to transaction data. On top of this, offering a variety of pieces is a necessity for most stores and predictions which favour only certain types, e.g. 'pants' would have unrealistic consequences to the buying strategy of these stores.

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on? 

First of all, there is not a concrete interest at this point in time to initiate this project. This idea was solely shared in the light of the Building AI Course. However, would this become relevant a first step would be to gather relevant data sources. Skills are foreseen in the current ecosystem I am working in.
